# Supabase Auth and Governance Hardening Design

**Status:** Approved by System Owner on 2026-08-10

**Task ID:** `governance-auth-hardening-20260810`

**Reviewer / CODEOWNER:** `@phossatron`

## Goal

เปลี่ยน Formula Studio จาก client-only login และ anonymous database access เป็น Supabase Auth + database-enforced membership/role controls โดยรักษา locked JSON data contract, single-file application, local-first behavior และ deterministic runtime ที่ไม่พึ่ง AI

## Scope

### Included

- Root GitHub governance and `@phossatron` CODEOWNER enforcement
- Supabase email/password authentication through direct REST `fetch()` calls
- Auth session lifecycle in `sessionStorage`
- Membership table and least-privilege RLS policies
- JSON mutation guards for role-sensitive application tables
- Removal of browser password hashes from server synchronization while retaining the locked `pass` field as `null`
- Deterministic test harness, migration tests, application tests, documentation, rollback and owner runbook

### Excluded

- Changing repository visibility or GitHub organization settings
- Applying a migration to production
- Reading production secrets or unmasked production data
- Inviting production users
- Final approval, merge or production deployment by Codex
- Adding an AI runtime or a new JavaScript dependency

## Constraints

- `index.html` remains the single application source file with no build step
- Existing localStorage keys and existing object fields/types remain backward compatible
- New fields and storage keys are optional
- Existing Excel columns are not reordered
- Runtime remains usable without AI; an already-authenticated open session continues using local data during network loss
- When server sync is configured, a new browser session must authenticate before cached production data is displayed
- Supabase publishable key is client configuration, not authorization; no secret/service-role key enters the browser or repository

## Architecture

### GitHub control plane

- `.github/CODEOWNERS` assigns all files to `@phossatron`
- Critical paths receive explicit ownership entries for `.github/`, `runtime/`, `supabase/` and `index.html`
- Pull request template records traceability, impact, tests, rollback and deployment evidence
- Branch protection, repository privacy and final approval remain System Owner actions

### Browser authentication

- The existing login form uses email and password against Supabase Auth REST
- The client calls `/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password` and accepts any successful 2xx response
- The returned `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at` and Auth user are stored in `sessionStorage` under new optional key `fs_auth_session`
- On page load, the client restores an unexpired session or refreshes it through `/auth/v1/token?grant_type=refresh_token`
- Logout calls `/auth/v1/logout`, clears `fs_auth_session`, `fs_user` and `fs_imp`, then returns to the login gate
- Data REST requests send the publishable key in `apikey` and the access token in `Authorization: Bearer`
- Auth responses and tokens are never logged or placed in activity records

### Membership and roles

Add `public.fs_memberships` as an authorization table separate from the locked application JSON:

```text
user_id uuid primary key -> auth.users(id)
name text not null
role text not null
active boolean not null default true
created_at timestamptz
updated_at timestamptz
```

- `role` is constrained to the existing Formula Studio roles
- `user_id` is indexed by its primary key; `role, active` receives a supporting index for policy checks
- `private.fs_is_active_member()`, `private.fs_current_role()` and `private.fs_current_name()` use `auth.uid()` and a fixed empty search path
- Helpers are callable only where required by RLS/guards and are not exposed through the Data API
- Existing Auth users are mapped to current `fs_users.data.email` by an owner-run migration statement
- Unmatched Auth users receive no membership and therefore no application access

### Database grants and RLS

- Revoke all application-table privileges from `anon`
- Grant only required CRUD privileges to `authenticated`
- Enable and force RLS on application tables and membership table
- Active membership is required for every application operation
- `fs_activities` is append-only; Admin alone can read it
- `fs_users` mutations require Admin
- `fs_meta` mutations require Admin or record-creation roles
- Record/chat policies apply coarse table-level role checks; `BEFORE UPDATE` JSON guards compare old/new payloads for sensitive role-specific changes
- Existing `anon_all` policies are removed transactionally in the migration

### JSON mutation guards

- Admin may perform all application-authorized changes
- Sales may create records attributed to their membership name and update only their own records
- OPC and MKT retain their current record capabilities
- PD may update formula/modification fields but not customer ownership or identity fields
- Chat participants may append messages, participation and seen state
- Approval changes are limited to Admin or the matching PD/RA/RD/Sales role
- Closed/reopened state follows the existing Admin/Sales/OPC rule
- Direct attempts that exceed these rules fail at the database even if UI checks are bypassed

## User lifecycle

- System Owner disables public signup and anonymous sign-in
- System Owner invites users through Supabase Dashboard; privileged invite secrets never enter the browser
- Initial migration joins Auth users to existing `fs_users` by normalized email and creates memberships
- New users are invited first, then assigned a membership by the Owner/Admin operating procedure
- In-app user creation and Admin password reset are disabled when secure server mode is active; the UI explains the Dashboard-controlled process
- Users change or recover passwords through Supabase Auth flows rather than `pwHash()`

## Offline behavior

- AI availability never affects runtime
- After a successful login, local editing continues while the network is unavailable and queues synchronization
- Reconnection refreshes authentication before pushing queued changes
- Browser restart or expired session requires a new login before cached server-derived data is shown
- Local-only mode remains available only when Supabase configuration is intentionally absent

## Error handling

- Authentication errors use a generic invalid-credentials message and never reveal account existence
- Refresh failure clears the session and returns to login without deleting local application data
- 401/403 Data API responses pause sync and require authentication instead of retry-looping
- Network errors preserve local data and schedule bounded retry through the existing polling cycle
- Migration statements are transactional and idempotent; policy/trigger creation explicitly drops the prior named object before recreation

## Testing

- `harness.js` extracts and executes the real application script in an isolated browser context
- `test.html` reports deterministic browser tests without production credentials or data
- Unit/behavior tests cover auth request construction, session restore/refresh/logout, authenticated Data REST headers, local-only behavior and locked data compatibility
- SQL contract tests verify grants, policies, membership constraints, helper safety, JSON guard cases and rollback coverage using an isolated local/test database when available
- Every production behavior change follows RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Final verification includes JavaScript syntax, headless Chrome, SQL parser/local database where available, secret scan, diff review and governance checklist

## Rollout

1. Review and merge governance/CODEOWNERS/test foundation through PR
2. Owner changes repository to Private and enables branch protection
3. Create Auth users in staging and run the reviewed migration
4. Run RLS negative/positive tests and UAT in staging
5. Merge the application Auth change after independent review
6. Runtime Operator deploys the approved immutable commit and records health/rollback evidence
7. Repeat the reviewed migration and release process for production

## Rollback

- Application rollback: deploy the previously approved commit
- Database rollback: restore the named prior policies/grants from `supabase/rollback_auth_rls.sql`; do not drop application data
- Membership table remains harmless if the old client is restored
- If authentication fails after release, Runtime Operator rolls back the application first and Owner applies the reviewed policy rollback only when required

## Known limitations

- Codex cannot make the public repository private, configure branch protection, invite users, apply production SQL, approve or deploy
- The current GitHub development identity has read-only access until the Owner grants write permission
- Existing weak password hashes may remain in users' browser localStorage until the secure login path overwrites them; the server copy is retained as `pass: null` for shape compatibility
