# Supabase Auth and Governance Hardening Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make Formula Studio PR-ready with GitHub CODEOWNER controls, Supabase Auth, membership/role RLS, JSON mutation guards, deterministic browser tests and isolated PostgreSQL policy tests.

**Architecture:** Keep `index.html` as the only application file and use direct Supabase Auth/Data REST calls through `fetch()`. Add a separate authorization membership table and database policies/triggers without changing existing JSON object shapes; verify SQL in an isolated local PostgreSQL cluster with synthetic users and data.

**Tech Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node.js standard library, headless Google Chrome, PostgreSQL 17 command-line tools, POSIX shell, Supabase Auth/Data REST and Postgres RLS.

## Global Constraints

- Task ID: `governance-auth-hardening-20260810`
- Reviewer/CODEOWNER: `@phossatron`
- Environment: development/test only; no production access, migration or deployment
- Data classification: synthetic test data only
- Critical change: true
- Preserve all locked localStorage keys, JSON field names/types and Excel column order
- Keep the application single-file with no build step and no new runtime dependency
- Core runtime must work without AI and an authenticated open session must tolerate network loss
- Codex must not change repository visibility, permissions, branch protection or production state

---

### Task 1: GitHub ownership and governance controls

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Modify: `AGENTS.md`
- Modify: `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`
- Modify: `README.md`
- Modify: `RUNTIME_OPERATIONS.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: approved governance design and repository owner `@phossatron`
- Produces: repository-wide independent-review ownership and accurate secure-runtime instructions

- [ ] **Step 1: Add CODEOWNERS**

Use `@phossatron` for the default and explicitly repeat ownership for `.github/`, `runtime/`, `supabase/`, `index.html`, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` so critical areas remain obvious during review.

- [ ] **Step 2: Align governance text**

State that publishable frontend keys are configuration protected by Auth/RLS while secret/service-role keys are forbidden, and add the selected secure-auth design/runbook references.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the control diff**

Run: `git diff --check && rg -n "@phossatron|service-role|secret key|Supabase Auth" .github AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md README.md RUNTIME_OPERATIONS.md`

Expected: exit 0; no conflicting Codex/runtime roles and no secret value output.

### Task 2: Deterministic browser test foundation and RED auth tests

**Files:**
- Create: `harness.js`
- Create: `tests/formula-studio.test.js`
- Generate (ignored): `test.html`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: real `index.html`
- Produces: `node harness.js` and a headless-browser result containing `FORMULA_STUDIO_TESTS: PASS <count>` or a non-zero failure marker

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the dependency-free harness**

`harness.js` reads `index.html`, replaces only the test copy's Supabase configuration with empty values, injects `tests/formula-studio.test.js` immediately before `</body>`, and writes `test.html`. It must fail if the expected script/config/body markers are absent.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write failing browser tests**

Cover these observable behaviors using real `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` and a fake only at the external `fetch` boundary:

```text
secure login stores a normalized session and authenticated membership
Data REST sends publishable apikey plus Bearer access token
secure boot never trusts fs_user without an Auth session
refresh replaces an expiring access token
logout clears Auth/local identity without clearing application records
401/403 pauses sync and requires login
local-only mode keeps the legacy login path
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run RED**

Run: `node harness.js` then headless Chrome against `test.html`.

Expected: FAIL because `authSignIn`, `authRestoreSession` and authenticated Data REST behavior do not exist.

### Task 3: Minimal Supabase Auth client and secure boot

**Files:**
- Modify: `index.html`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SB_URL`, `SB_KEY`, login form, `sessionStorage`, `fetch`, current local stores
- Produces: `authSignIn(email,password)`, `authRestoreSession()`, `authRefreshSession()`, `authSignOut()`, `authFetchMembership()`, `authDataHeaders()` and an auth-gated `sbBoot()`

- [ ] **Step 1: Implement session normalization/storage**

Use optional key `fs_auth_session`; persist only in `sessionStorage`; compute `expires_at` from `expires_in` when needed; never log token contents.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement Auth REST requests**

POST password and refresh grants to `/auth/v1/token`, call `/auth/v1/logout`, accept all `response.ok` 2xx responses, and use generic credential errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Gate identity and cached data**

When `sbOn()` is true, do not trust persisted `fs_user`; restore/refresh Auth first, fetch the caller's active membership, then set `currentUser/currentMembership` and begin Data REST synchronization. Local-only mode retains the legacy path.

- [ ] **Step 4: Authenticate Data REST**

Keep the publishable key in `apikey`; use the access token, never the publishable key, as the Bearer credential. On 401/403, stop synchronization, clear identity/session and show login without deleting records.

- [ ] **Step 5: Remove weak password behavior from secure mode**

Secure mode uses email/password Auth only, never creates a first local Admin, never changes another user's password in-browser, and normalizes server `fs_users[].pass` to `null` while retaining the field.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN browser tests**

Run the same harness/Chrome command.

Expected: all Task 2 tests pass with no console error.

### Task 4: RED isolated PostgreSQL authorization tests

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/sql/bootstrap.sql`
- Create: `tests/sql/auth_rls_test.sql`
- Create: `tests/run-sql-tests.sh`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: local `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, `psql`, forward schema and rollback SQL
- Produces: isolated synthetic PostgreSQL assertions with no network or production database

- [ ] **Step 1: Build the Supabase-compatible test fixture**

Create synthetic `anon`, `authenticated`, `service_role`, `auth.users` and `auth.uid()` behavior using `request.jwt.claim.sub`; never include real project values.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add failing policy/guard assertions**

Tests must demonstrate:

```text
anon cannot read/write application tables
unknown/inactive Auth user cannot access data
active member can read shared records
Sales can change own record but not another owner's record
PD can change formula fields but not customer/owner fields
RA can change RA approval but not PD approval
non-Admin can append activity but cannot read or mutate the log
Admin can manage memberships and users
pass remains present and null in server user JSON
forward SQL can run twice without failure
rollback SQL restores the named legacy policies without dropping data
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run RED**

Run: `./tests/run-sql-tests.sh`

Expected: FAIL because the secure schema, policies and guards are absent.

### Task 5: Secure forward schema and rollback

**Files:**
- Modify: `supabase/schema.sql`
- Create: `supabase/rollback_auth_rls.sql`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: existing locked tables and Supabase `auth.users/auth.uid()`
- Produces: idempotent membership schema, grants, RLS policies, mutation guards and explicit rollback

- [ ] **Step 1: Restore locked application tables**

Recreate the five existing JSON tables and timestamp trigger exactly with `IF NOT EXISTS`, preserving keys/data columns.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add membership and helpers**

Create `public.fs_memberships`, role constraint/index, `private.fs_is_active_member()`, `private.fs_current_role()` and `private.fs_current_name()` with fixed search path and explicit grants/revokes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Replace anonymous policies transactionally**

Drop `anon_all`, revoke `anon`, grant minimum authenticated operations, enable/force RLS and create membership/role policies.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add JSON guards**

Add record and chat `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` guards that compare old/new JSON, enforce Sales ownership, limit PD record fields, constrain close state, protect immutable IDs and restrict each approval key to its matching role/Admin.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add initial membership migration block**

Join existing `fs_users.data.email` to `auth.users.email`; insert only valid known roles; leave unmatched users unauthorized; set every server `fs_users.data.pass` to JSON null without deleting the key.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add explicit rollback**

Restore legacy anonymous policies only as a reviewed emergency compatibility rollback; retain all tables/data and document that it reopens the legacy security risk.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run GREEN SQL tests twice**

Run: `./tests/run-sql-tests.sh && ./tests/run-sql-tests.sh`

Expected: both isolated runs pass and clean up their temporary clusters.

### Task 6: Secure user-management UI and synchronization regressions

**Files:**
- Modify: `index.html`
- Modify: `tests/formula-studio.test.js`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: secure membership/current role and existing user modal/sync engine
- Produces: safe secure-mode UI, offline queue preservation and no Auth token leakage

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED regression tests**

Add tests that secure mode disables first-Admin creation, Admin invite/reset controls explain Dashboard ownership, offline queued records survive boot reconciliation, and activity/error rendering never contains tokens.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

Run harness/Chrome and confirm failures name the missing secure behavior.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement minimal UI/sync changes**

Keep legacy local-only controls unchanged. In secure mode show Dashboard-managed onboarding guidance, preserve queued local objects before applying a server snapshot, and strip token-like values from displayed/logged errors.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify GREEN**

Run browser tests and confirm all pass without console errors.

### Task 7: Documentation, verification and PR-ready commits

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md`
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`
- Modify: `RUNTIME_OPERATIONS.md`
- Create: `supabase/AUTH_RLS_RUNBOOK.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: final implementation and verified commands
- Produces: exact Owner/Reviewer/Runtime steps, health evidence and rollback instructions

- [ ] **Step 1: Document one-time Owner actions**

Private repository, development write access, branch protection, disabled public signup/anonymous sign-in, staging Auth invitations, reviewed SQL execution and UAT.

- [ ] **Step 2: Document Reviewer and Runtime gates**

Require `@phossatron`, test evidence, staging RLS negative tests, immutable commit SHA, health check and rollback target. Do not imply Codex deploys.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run full fresh verification**

```sh
node --check <(sed -n '/<script>/,/<\/script>/p' index.html)
node harness.js
./tests/run-sql-tests.sh
headless Chrome test.html
plutil -lint runtime/com.beyond-formula.runtime.plist
for f in runtime/*.sh tests/*.sh; do sh -n "$f"; done
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Expected: every executable check exits 0, browser report contains only PASS, no secret/service-role key is found and unrelated pre-existing work remains preserved.

- [ ] **Step 4: Review and commit coherent changes**

Create separate local commits for governance/test foundation, secure schema, secure application behavior and documentation. Do not push if GitHub permission remains read-only; report the exact Owner action needed.
